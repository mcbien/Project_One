# Project_One
Michael Bien, Project One, Group One
IMPORTANT NOTE: This repo is effectively a branch of our main project repo located here: https://github.com/debrawu/ProjectOne

What happened? We had initially decided to use branching in our project repo.  I had to make changes to my branch files and my portion of the repo became out of sync, so I created a new repo to continue with my portion of the project.

For a full list of my commits please see:
1. My branch on the main project here: https://github.com/debrawu/ProjectOne/tree/mcbien
2. The commits within my repo (this repo) here: https://github.com/mcbien/Project_One

A full write-up of the project can be found here: https://github.com/debrawu/ProjectOne/blob/master/README.md

Sorry for the complexity here.

Thanks,

Michael
